# Tensai

It's a simple, easy-to-use library that provides various features for server owners and developers to aid in
ameliorating the vanilla gameplay. Besides of that, Tensai should provide stability and compatibility to prevent conflicts with other
plugins and mods.

Tensai (天際 / てんさい) is a Japanese word (Romanji form) means 'horizon/the edge of the sky'.
